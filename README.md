Application to pairing RFID device with employee

Old design used to lend equipment in storage<br /><br />

The user scans his RFID card, retrieves the device, scans it, and then the device is assigned to him for the duration of the work.<br />
Afterwards, he returns the device in the same way.<br /><br />

The person operating the workstation can see the devices, where they are and who rented them. <br />
